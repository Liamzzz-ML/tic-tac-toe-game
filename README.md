# tic-tac-toe-game

A small game project written in C++ as a way to practice and strengthen my programming skills

Through creating this Tic Tac Toe game in C++, I gained a deeper understanding of function usage, loop structures, and modular program design. The project required me to divide the code into multiple functions—such as for drawing the board, handling user input, checking for a win or a draw—and then integrate these with while and for loops to ensure the game runs smoothly from start to finish.

One major takeaway was my improved understanding of Boolean logic. I used Boolean values to check whether the board was full, whether a player had won, or whether the game ended in a draw. These checks were essential for determining the game outcome in real time.

I also practiced working with arrays to represent the 3×3 game board. Arrays helped me efficiently store the state of each square and implement the win conditions by checking specific combinations of array values. In doing so, I also strengthened my grasp of if statements and conditional logic.

Lastly, the process of drawing the board using characters like vertical bars (|) and dashes (-) helped me understand how to visually structure console output, and how small formatting adjustments can make a big difference in user experience.
